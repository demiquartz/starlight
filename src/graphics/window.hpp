 * @brief Create and manage a window.
 *
 * This class provides functionality to create and manage a window for graphics rendering.
 * It encapsulates the platform-specific window creation and management logic.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Create an instance of Window by providing the title, width, height, and visibility.
 * - The destructor will automatically clean up the window resources when the object is destroyed.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * Window window("My Window", 1280, 720, true);
 * // Use the window...
 * @endcode
