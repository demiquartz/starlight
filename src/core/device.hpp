 * @brief Manage the GPU device.
 *
 * This class provides functionality to manage the GPU device for graphics rendering and physics calculations.
 * It encapsulates the platform-specific device management logic.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - Create an instance of Device.
 * - The destructor will automatically clean up the device resources when the object is destroyed.
 *
 * Example:
 * @code
 * Starlight::Core::Device device;
 * // Use the device...
 * @endcode
